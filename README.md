# Soil-Moisture-Monitoring-and-Alert-System-using-Arduino-Uno
This project utilizes an Arduino Uno board to measure soil moisture levels using a soil moisture sensor. When the moisture level drops below a predefined threshold, the system alerts the user by lighting up a red LED and activating a buzzer. If the soil moisture is sufficient, a green LED lights up to indicate no watering is required.
